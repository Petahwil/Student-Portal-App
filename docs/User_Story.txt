Karen Volis

Karen needs an application to automate the TA/RA Time card signatures. This
application will allow workers to come in and sign their time sheets on a
tablet. At the end of each week, it will send Karen an email with an excel
sheet of the results for that week. If a person hasnâ€™t come in to sign their
time card after a week, the app will send an auto email to the TA/RA and Karen
stating they have not signed yet for that specific week. Also, this app may
contain frequently asked questions so that students can refer to the app
rather than having to ask Karen.
